Object class is present in java.lang package. Every class in Java is directly or indirectly derived from the Object class.
If a class does not extend any other class then it is a direct child class of Object and if extends another class then it is indirectly derived.
Therefore the Object class methods are available to all Java classes.
Hence Object class acts as a root of the inheritance hierarchy in any Java Program.
Class Object is the root of the class hierarchy. Every class has Object as a superclass.
All objects, including arrays, implement the methods of this class.
