/**
 * Differences between List and Set:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>Duplicates:</b> Lists can contain duplicate elements. If you need to maintain a collection of elements that can contain duplicates, use a List. Sets don't allow duplicates. If you need to ensure that each element is unique, use a Set.</li>
 *   <li><b>Order:</b> Lists maintain the order of insertion, while Sets do not. If the order of elements is important, use a List. Sets do not maintain the order of insertion. If you do not care about the order, use a Set.</li>
 *   <li><b>Positional Access:</b> Lists allow for positional access to elements, meaning you can access an element by its index. Sets do not provide positional access. You can only check if an element is in the set or not.</li>
 *   <li><b>Performance:</b> Lists generally have better performance than Sets for positional access because Lists use an index to access elements, which is faster than checking every element in a Set for membership.</li>
 *   <li><b>Membership Testing:</b> Sets have better performance than Lists for testing membership.</li>
 * </ul>
