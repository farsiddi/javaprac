/**
 * Virtual Threads are lightweight threads introduced in Java 21 (as a stable feature) through [Project Loom].
 * <br>
 * They are managed by the JVM, not the operating system, and are much more efficient than traditional threads.
 *
 * <h3>Key Benefits:</h3>
 *
 * <ul>
 *     <li><b>Non-blocking Real OS Threads:</b> Virtual threads use a lightweight scheduling mechanism, enabling high-concurrency applications
 *         to efficiently manage many tasks without blocking the underlying OS threads.</li>
 *     <li><b>High Concurrency:</b> Virtual threads are ideal for applications requiring high concurrency, such as servers handling millions of
 *         incoming requests, allowing you to scale efficiently with minimal resource overhead.</li>
 *     <li><b>Simplified Code:</b> With virtual threads, you can write blocking code in a simpler, sequential style, avoiding complex asynchronous
 *         programming patterns like callbacks, promises, or reactive streams that are typically used for handling high concurrency.</li>
 * </ul>
