1 -if there is a scenario where a class in extending the same method, having same method signature from a superclass and superinterface
    then superclass wins in this because the compiler is configured this way

2- If there are two interfaces A and B having same methods and there is another interface AB which extends both A and B
    then comes a class Z which  implements interface AB and A, then AB will be given preference because it is the most specific case.
    this goes for both abstract as well as default method
